    "This notebook illustrates composite wavefunctions created by summing stationary-state wavefunctions produced by the QuantumWell solver.  Specifically, it provides an animation over time of the composite wavefunction from the first two stationary states of a potential well with a single internal potential barrier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The potential well details and the stationary state wavefunctions were previously created using the potential-well solver with the results stored in a .dpw file. After adding the time dependent function, the animated plot occurs in an external window, possibly hidden behind this window. If so, move this window to find it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this notebook in any directory provided that you copy the `getPath.py` file\n",
    "as well `psi1.dpw` and `psi2.dpw` files to that directory  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Read stationary state wavefunctions produced by the quantum potential-well solver\n",
    "*  Verify Normalization\n",
    "*  Create composite wavefunctions and check normalization\n",
    "*  Track the composite probability density over time with an animation\n"
